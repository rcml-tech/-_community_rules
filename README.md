# The RCML Community rules

## What is RCML?
RCML is acronime of The Robot Control Meta Library, old name is The Robot Control Meta Language.
It is programming toolkit for robotics, that was focus at industrial robotics and mobile industrial robotics. But now it open for all robotics.

The RCML approach is the independing of programming apps for robotics, from hardware of robot.

One boring example from industrial robotics: *if your app need only moving worl tool only in XYZ coordinates, then you use 4-axis robot class (4 axis is enought to XYZ movements) in code of your app. And you should'n care about which brand of robot, that will work with your app. Or how many axes it have, because 5- and 6-axis robots also can execute XYZ movements. The RCML verify, that robot is compatibility with your app. And it don't allow your app work with wrong robots, which is incompatible app's features.*

So this approach can create new era and new market in programming sphere.
**Era of robotics programmers, new market of robotics software**, when any programmer can create app for any robot.
Like now, when any programmer can create mobile app and don't carry out about what is CPU,  or matherboard, or RAMM within every device.

But again, **this talk not about hardware compatibility, it about functional compatibility by programming tools**.
It is mission of the RCML.

This file contains information about basic rules for whole The RCML Community.
Thise rules are default for most projects of community. The specififc project rules are decribed for each repos in this Comminity.
